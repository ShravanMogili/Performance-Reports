Find Most Expensive Stored Procedure (By Execution Count)

 An important step in optimizing a system is to take a holistic approach and look at stored procedures that are called very often. These procedures can often be the backbone of a system. Sometimes optimizing these procedures can have a dramatic effect on relieving the physical bottlenecks of the system and improving end-user experience.
The following DMV query shows the execution count of each stored procedure, sorted by the most executed procedures first.


SELECT DB_NAME(SQTX.DBID) AS [DBNAME]
	,OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(SQTX.OBJECTID, DBID) AS [SCHEMA]
	,OBJECT_NAME(SQTX.OBJECTID, DBID) AS [STORED PROC]
	,MAX(CPLAN.USECOUNTS) [EXEC COUNT]
FROM SYS.DM_EXEC_CACHED_PLANS CPLAN
CROSS APPLY SYS.DM_EXEC_SQL_TEXT(CPLAN.PLAN_HANDLE) SQTX
WHERE DB_NAME(SQTX.DBID) IS NOT NULL
	AND CPLAN.OBJTYPE = 'PROC'
GROUP BY CPLAN.PLAN_HANDLE
	,DB_NAME(SQTX.DBID)
	,OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(OBJECTID, SQTX.DBID)
	,OBJECT_NAME(OBJECTID, SQTX.DBID)
ORDER BY MAX(CPLAN.USECOUNTS) DESC
