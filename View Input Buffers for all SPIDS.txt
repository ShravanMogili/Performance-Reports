This procedure, sp_AllInputBuffers, uses dynamic T-SQL to generate and execute the DBCC INPUTBUFFER statement for each server process (except yours).  Perfect for performance troubleshooting situations, when you want to see what commands are being executed against your server.  Also, a great example of the power of dynamic T-SQL.

For the @exec parameter, pass 1 or leave it blank to execute the DBCC statements; pass 0 if you only want to view the statements being generated.
