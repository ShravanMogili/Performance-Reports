Analyzing Dangerous Settings in SQL Server - 3

http://www.sqlservercentral.com/scripts/102129/

 To analyze dangerous settings in your SQL Server, just copy, paste and execute this script.

Please test this on you development system first.

Once executed the script will detect your SQL server setting and look for any dangerous settings. If dangerous settings are detected, text will be displayed with more information. No settings are changed so you will have to make the changes manually.

Here is what the code is looking at

Max Work Treads - setting may cause blokcing tand thread pool error/issues

Priority Boost - Setting will drain OS and network functions and cause errors/issues

Light Weight Pooling - CLR not supported uner lightweight pooling

Affinity I/O Mask - I/O and processor affinity changes will cause strange issues/errors and is not necessary on and 64 bit server

Only use/change dangerous SQL server setting when instructed by Microsoft support to fix a specific issue/problem. 



-- SQL Server Dangerous Settings
--
-- If any of the below setting are used (other than default) you will experience issues. 
-- Only use these settings if recommended by Microsoft Suppport.
